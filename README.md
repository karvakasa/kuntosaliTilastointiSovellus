# kuntosaliTilastointiSovellus

- Intention is to make Gym Statistics app, where we log in first so we just see our stats.
- after registering or logging in we can add done exersices
- we can both see when we have logged in onto the app and also see old Gym statistics
- if time, you can specify more which stats you want see and not only by equipment
- if time, atm heroku is 3h late, and would want make it not late

App works now properly and no errors found by dev. Starter you get to page where you can log in or click button to register.
Link Startpage goes everywhere, where ever you navigate on the app. Before loggin in it goes back to the first page. After logging in it will redirect you to gym stats adding page. As you are Logged in, you can add new gym stats or check when you have been logging in the past by link. Or you can go check your own Statistics. There is also log out link below addind option in Startpage.
